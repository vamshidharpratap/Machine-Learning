<pre>
<b>Age</b>: Patients Age in years (Numeric)  <br />

<b>Sex</b>: Gender (Nominal) <br />
    1 : Male
    0 : Female 

<b>cp</b> = Chest Pain (Nominal) <br />
     Angina is a chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. <br />
     0 typical angina  <br />
     1 atypical angina  <br />
     2 non- anginal pain  <br />
     3 asymptomatic  <br /> 
     
<b>trestbps</b>: patient's level of blood pressure at resting mode in mm/HG (Numerical) <br />
          mm/HG is millimeter per mercury  <br />

<b>chol</b>: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl (Numeric)  <br />
      mg/dl milligrams(mg) per decilitre(dL)  <br />
      mg = 1/1000 grams  <br />
      dl = 1/10 litre  <br />
      
<b>fbs</b>: Blood sugar levels on fasting > 120 mg/dl represents as 1 in case of true and 0 as false (Nominal)  <br />

<b>restecg</b>: Result of electrocardiogram while at rest are represented in 3 distinct values  <br />
         0 : Normal  <br />
         1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)  <br />
         2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophyby Estes' criteria (Nominal)  <br />
         
<b>thalach</b>: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric)  <br />

<b>exang</b>: Angina induced by exercise (Nominal)  <br />
       0 : depicting NO  <br />
       1 : depicting Yes   <br />

<b>oldpeak</b>: Exercise induced ST-depression in relative with the state of rest (Numeric)  <br />
         An ST depression can be an outcome of an electrocardiogram (ECG) test. It can indicate health   <br />
         conditions like hypokalemia, myocardial ischemia, or a side effect of medications.  <br />
         
<b>slope</b>: ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise (Nominal)  <br />
       0: up sloping  <br />
       1: flat  <br />
       2: down sloping <br />
<b>ca</b>: The number of major vessels (0â€“3)(nominal) <br />

<b>thal</b>: A blood disorder called thalassemia (nominal) <br />
      0: NULL <br />
      1: normal blood flow  <br />
      2: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart) <br />
      3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal) <br />
      
<b>target</b>: It is the target variable which we have to predict  <br />
        1 = means patient is suffering from heart disease  <br />
        0 = means patient is normal.  <br />
